A [data model](https://service.tib.eu/webvowl/#opts=doc=0;filter_sco=true;mode_compact=true;#iri=https://query20251112104247-h6affebdd4gfa4bs.uksouth-01.azurewebsites.net/schema.ttl) to describe volunteering opportunities and volunteer-involving organisations.


## How to participate?

We are always looking to improve this data model.

Please don't hesitate to contribute to the [discussions](https://github.com/orgs/volunteeringdata/discussions/) on the volunteering data model repository. We created 7 main categories to focus on specific areas of development and expertise: [Accessibility](https://github.com/orgs/volunteeringdata/discussions/categories/accessibility); [Data Governance](https://github.com/orgs/volunteeringdata/discussions/categories/data-governance); [Emergency Response](https://github.com/orgs/volunteeringdata/discussions/categories/emergency-response); [Geographical Location](https://github.com/orgs/volunteeringdata/discussions/categories/geographical-location); [Roles and Skills](https://github.com/orgs/volunteeringdata/discussions/categories/roles-and-skills); [Volunteer Involving Organisation](https://github.com/orgs/volunteeringdata/discussions/categories/volunteer-involving-organisation); [Volunteering Opportunities](https://github.com/orgs/volunteeringdata/discussions/categories/volunteering-opportunities).


## Process

The Volunteering and Social Action draft data standard is developed in the open with volunteering specialists, software providers, and data experts, bringing domain expertise to collaborate on the standardisation effort.

A landscape review of the Voluntary, Community, and Social Enterprise (VCSE) sector helped identify an initial list of [use cases](./use-cases/README.md) that could inform the standardisation effort.

A [Standards Working Group](https://theodi.org/news-and-events/blog/join-the-volunteering-data-standards-working-group/) helps with gathering feedback and informing development of the standard.

A [Hackathon](https://theodi.org/news-and-events/events/open-data-infrastructure-for-volunteering-hackathon/) brought together subject matter experts, raising awareness of the standardisation effort, and informing the [direction of our efforts](./hackathon/README.md).


## Versions

The data model's evolution is documented as a [series of versions](./version/README.md).
