# Volunteering and Social Action Ontology

The volunteering and social action ontology aims to standardise the representation of volunteering opportunities and volunteer-involving organisations so that data and associated tooling become reusable and can be shared across the Voluntary, Community, and Social Enterprise (VCSE) sector.

Standard data models designed to address the challenges faced by a sector are the base for information systems interoperability. Their adoption lowers both the cost and technical barrier for entry into a data ecosystem.

The adequacy of a standard model enables simple solutions to use cases that may otherwise be challenging to address.

Ultimately, information systems relying on adequate standards enable a diverse, equitable and inclusive data ecosystem allowing us to focus time and efforts on users and improving processes that directly address their needs.


## Process

Standards must be grounded in practical knowledge and experience of the sector they're designed for. Subject Matter Experts (SME), that is, a diverse group of people with varied and extensive experience of the sector, are the first point of contact in any standardisation effort. SMEs shared knowledge constitutes the base and justification for every data modelling decision in a standard.

Following that principle, the volunteering and social action ontology is developed in the open with volunteering specialists, software providers, and data experts, bringing the necessary domain expertise to collaborate on the standardisation effort.

### Discovery

A landscape review of the Voluntary, Community, and Social Enterprise (VCSE) sector helped identify an initial list of [use cases](./use-cases/) that could inform the standardisation effort.

### Alpha

A [Standards Working Group](https://theodi.org/news-and-events/blog/join-the-volunteering-data-standards-working-group/) helps with gathering feedback and informing development of the standard.

A [Hackathon](https://theodi.org/news-and-events/events/open-data-infrastructure-for-volunteering-hackathon/) brought together subject matter experts, raising awareness of the standardisation effort, and informing the [direction of our efforts](./hackathon/).


## Contributing Knowledge to the Volunteering and Social Action Ontology

We welcome domain experts and people with varied experiences of volunteering to contribute their knowledge of the sector. Shared knowledge is the basis to ensure our standard adequately provides structure to address the volunteering sector's needs.

### Discussion Topics

Please don't hesitate to contribute to the [discussions](https://github.com/orgs/volunteeringdata/discussions/) on the volunteering data model repository.

We created 7 main categories for focused discussions on specific modeling and requirements topics:

## Data Model

The volunteering and social action ontology can be [visualized through WebVOWL](https://service.tib.eu/webvowl/#opts=doc=0;filter_sco=true;mode_compact=true;#iri=https://query20251112104247-h6affebdd4gfa4bs.uksouth-01.azurewebsites.net/schema.ttl), a web-based ontology visualization tool.

The volunteering and social action ontology is implemented using RDF, a native data format for the semantic web. RDF enables the [5-star](https://5stardata.info/en/) deployment scheme for Open Data; a scheme suggested by Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the Web and [Linked Data](https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/LinkedData.html) initiator.


## Standardisation History

The data model's evolution is documented as a [series of versions](./version/) to document its evolution over time.
