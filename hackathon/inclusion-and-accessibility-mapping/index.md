# Accessibility and Inclusion Taxonomy Mapping

This is a taxonomy of inclusion and accessibility.

We are always looking to improve this data model. Please don't hesitate to [contribute to the discussion](https://github.com/orgs/volunteeringdata/discussions/categories/accessibility).

## Model

The mapping of accessibility and inclusion considerations for volunteering 
activities and organisations is intended to provide a more comprehensive list of accessibility
considerations for organisations when advertising volunteering opportunities.
