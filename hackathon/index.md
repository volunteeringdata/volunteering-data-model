title: Open Data Infrastructure for Volunteering Hackathon
---

[A two-days hackathon](https://theodi.org/news-and-events/events/open-data-infrastructure-for-volunteering-hackathon/) bringing together volunteer platforms, developers, and community organisations to test the first draft of the volunteering standard and explore how open data can connect more people with opportunities to help.


## Themes

1. The intelligent opportunity matchmaker: How can we use standardised data to move beyond simple keyword search?
2. The conversational and generative search agent: Can finding a volunteer role be as easy as asking a friend?
3. [Inclusion and accessibility mapping](./inclusion-and-accessibility-mapping/): How can we use data to broaden reach and ensure no one is excluded?
4. [Crisis response and spontaneous volunteering](./crisis-response-and-spontaneous-volunteering/): How can a volunteering data infrastructure be used to rapidly find and deploy volunteers in an emergency (e.g. a flood)?
