<h1>Open Data Infrastructure for Volunteering Hackathon</h1>

A two-day hackathon bringing together volunteer platforms, developers, and community organisations to test the first draft of the standard and explore how open data can connect more people with opportunities to help.

## Themes

1. The intelligent opportunity matchmaker: How can we use standardised data to move beyond simple keyword search?
2. The conversational and generative search agent: Can finding a volunteer role be as easy as asking a friend?
3. [Inclusion and accessibility mapping](./inclusion-and-accessibility-mapping/index.md): How can we use data to broaden reach and ensure no one is excluded?
4. [Crisis response and spontaneous volunteering](./crisis-response-and-spontaneous-volunteering/index.md): How can this data infrastructure be rapidly deployed in an emergency (eg, a flood)?
